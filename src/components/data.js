        "The Classic Vibe™ Active ’70s Jazz Bass® draws its inspiration from the infamous basses that defined the funky tones of the 1970s, adding an onboard preamp for the ultimate combination of vintage looks and modern performance. Powering this Squier® groove machine is a pair of Fender Designed™ alnico Noiseless™ J Bass® pickups for punchy hum-free signal. The 9-volt preamp provides controls for volume, pickup blend, treble and bass boost, and a toggle to switch between active and passive for complete tone-shaping control. Other details include a HiMass™ bridge for optimal resonance, a striking bound fingerboard with block inlays, rich-looking nickel-plated hardware and a slick vintage-tinted gloss neck finish for an old-school vibe."
